                <h3>Junior java developer</h3>

                <p>I am Michael Araya a chess enthusiast and a coffee snob now turned java developer living in Brussel.</p>

                <p>I fell in love with programming not only for its rewarding technical challenges, but for its community. 
                    The developers and collaborators that I've been lucky enough to meet, have provided me with unexpected warmth, passion, and creativity; a wonderful pattern
                     I strive to continue.</p>
                <p>In my study of java programming with IOT in INTEC BRUSSEL gave me the necessary knowledge in Java programming, and tools to be able to learn new technologies by myself. </p>   
                <p>As I grow, refocus, design, scrap, build, and discover all the brilliance in this field, I take time to pause. 
                    I am passionate about attending Meetups in many disciplines, learning and working on new skills that gives me an edge in the industry.
