                <p>I am Michael Araya a chess enthusiast and a coffee snob now turned self-taught web developer in Gent.

                    I fell in love with web development not only for its rewarding technical challenges, but for its community. The developers and collaborators that I've been lucky enough to meet, have provided me with unexpected warmth, passion, and creativity; a wonderful pattern I strive to continue.
                    
                    As I grow, refocus, design, scrap, build, and discover all the brilliance in this field, I take time to pause. I am passionate about attending Meetups in many disciplines, learning and working on new skills that gives me an edge in the industry.
